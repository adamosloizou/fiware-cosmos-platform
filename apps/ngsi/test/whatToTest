01. Simple registration
    % curlTest reg firstReg 
    
    Check that all is in DB
------------------------------------------------------------------
02. Check that data is recovered/found in DB on restart
    - kill ngsi process and run the same command again
    % curlTest reg firstReg
    - should fail as we cannot register an entity twice ...
