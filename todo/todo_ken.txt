o Friday 25/2:  Test with 9 Workers
                Stress the Supervisor
o Controller sometimes loosing hostname when saving a Worker 
  This makes the Supervisor believe the Worker is totally uninitialized ...

o Buttons in LogTab
o Retrieve logFile and old logFile
o Will probably need list of processes in LogTab as well ... Complicated !

o Memory leaks ...

o (ANDREU) Pestanya en samsonSupervisor con una grafica utilizando la libreria QWT ( http://qwt.sourceforge.net/ )
o (ANDREU) Method to send a packet to all delilahs and supervisor (workers as well?)
o (ANDREU) Metodo para averiguar la cola (numero de paquetes y tamanyo) de salida para cada endpoint

o Refactoring of NetworkInterface - the whole callback story ...

o Implement '-toDo' in paParse 
o Get rid of all Endpoint::Temporal
o EndpointMgr for Network

o Problems at home when VPN functioning ...
  HostMgr seems OK, but when killing and starting Controller, a running worker isn't detected ...

o When spawning a process, make sure the data saved in the workerVector is used!
o Whenever Process name, alias, ip is changed, its Enpoint counterparts must also be changed!
o Implement a way to retrieve the old log file AND the entire new log file.

o Stop using 'QueueMgr', 'SourceMgr' and 'ResultMgr' - use the one and only 'SceneItemMgr'
  - will need to add a few methods from SQR managers to SceneItemMgr, I guess ...

o MenuBar etc in supervisor window ... ?

o LogTab
  - A QPushButton to resizeColumnsToContents()
  - Fix the sizes of the columns initially (more or less)
  - Possibility to have a window per process ?
  - A button to download the entire log file
  - A button to download the entire OLD log file
  - Change name of ConfigWindow to LogConfigWindow
  - Include the CheckBox 'Send log to Supervisor' in LogConfigWindow
  - When a process dies, its window in LogServer stays, just that later if I
    manually restart the process, another window appears in the LogServer window ...
    I must check if existing before I create a new List in the LogServer
===============================================================================
o Refactoring
  - samsonSupervisor - QueueMgr, SourceMgr and ResultMgr should be ONE manager - SceneItemMgr
  - Try to not use iomMsgSend(int fd, ...)
  - Close On Exec for all sockets ... ?
  - Network.cpp
    - shorten too long nethods
    - move parts to main_
  - What name to use: Data Sets or Queues ?
===============================================================================
o Really create the queues in samsonController
  - But not to be executed until RUN
  - When terminated, some graphical way to show the results
===============================================================================
o Stability
  - Sometimes coredumps at startup
  - Test with 9 Workers
  - Stability Tests ...

===============================================================================
o Tonterias
  - More Config about logMsg (Keep lines, Empty log file, etc.)
  - Replace QCheckbox in ProcessListTab for something nicer, with pixmaps and stuff ...
    - Perhaps a checkbox to include in LogServer window
    - Pixmaps: Red, Yellow and Green
    - Enter a config page when process name is clicked - connect/unconnect when pixmap is clicked
  - Animations for error login and running chain ?
  - While running, the whole chain should be in "disabled" mode.
    - a button to cancel the operation.
  - Make the Queues and Connection lines highlight when the cursor moves over them (hover?)
  - The modes of a Queue/Source/Config Scene Item:
    1. When a queue is created, a lighter icon
    2. When the queue is really created (command sent to Controller), its real icon should be shown.
    3. Disable 
  - Nicer SceneTab popups
    - ls              View Queues    (data sets (Queues) - show, add, remove, clear ...) 
    - operations      Command List   (Window with filters: "Starts with", "Ends in", ...)
    - datas           Data Types     (Actually, this is 'Types' - this list will be used in QueueConfigWindow)
    - upload          Upload         (file selection dialog to choose file to upload)
    - load            Load           (just a text window - showing the current status of upload and downloads)
    - download        Download       (popup window to ask for set_name AND local_file_name)
  - ProcessListTab - Controller on top of the list, before any worker ...
  - Way to change size of logProvider log window
===============================================================================
o Permissions and Users
  - Create Permission for every operation
  - Make each operation look in permissions before doing anything
===============================================================================
o samsonSupervisor startup:
  1.   Normal startup with everything running
  1.1. Connect to '-controller' - create Process
  1.2. Ask controller for WorkerVector 
  1.3. Connect to all workers - create Processes
  1.4. Connect to the controllers spawner - create Spawner
  1.5. Connect to each workers spawner - unless workers IP is II.PP and state Unconnected - cerate Spawners
  1.6. Start Qt and create Starters for all Pocess and Spawner

  2.   Initial startup - only spawners running
  2.1. Connect to '-controller' - FAILURE and POPUP
  2.2. Connect to the controllers spawner - create Spawner
  2.3. Start Qt and create Starter for the controller
  2.4. When user starts Controller - Ask controller for WorkerVector
  2.5. Connect to all workers - create Processes and Starters (as Qt already is running ...)

  3.   Strange startup (1) - not even controller's spawner is running
  3.1. Connect to '-controller' - FAILURE and POPUP
  3.2. Connect to the controllers spawnerPopup - FAILURE and POPUP
===============================================================================
