# Installing from Source 

## Ubuntu Package dependencies 

The following packages are required to be able to build SAMSON against Ubuntu
11.04: 

* git 
* boost-dev 
* ncurses-dev 
* make 
* gcc 
* cmake 
* libprotobuf-dev 
* protobuf-compiler 
* mongodb 
* libboost-filesystem-dev 
* libboost-thread-dev 
* qt4-qmake 
* libqt4-dev 
* help2man 
* libedit-dev 

To install them use the following command: 

    sudo apt-get install git-core libboost-dev ncurses-dev \
    make gcc g++ cmake libedit-dev libprotobuf-dev \
    protobuf-compiler mongodb libboost-filesystem-dev \
    libboost-thread-dev help2man libqt4-dev

## RedHat Package dependencies 

As with a package install building SAMSON from source on RHEL requires the use
of the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux. To enable this repository execute
the following: 

    wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm 
    rpm --Uhv epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm 

Once the additional repositories have been added install the required packages
using yum (assumes you have root access): 

    sudo yum install protobuf-compiler protobuf-devel \
    cmake boost-devel libedit-devel ncurses-devel \
    gcc gcc-c++ make qt-devel help2man tid-mongodb-devel \
    qtwebkit-devel expect rpm-build

## Building SAMSON 

In order to build SAMSON you first must download the source from SAMSONâ€™s Git
repository. The complete source tree, including modules can be checked out
using: 

    git clone git@pdihub.hi.inet:Cosmos/cosmos-platform.git

The installation process requires root access via the sudo command. Once you
have downloaded the source code run through the following setups to compile and
install SAMSON: 

1. enter the directory created by the Git command: 

    cd cosmos-platform/samson

2. compile and install SAMSON and all the modules 

    sudo make install 

Apart from compiling the source code for the SAMSON platform and its modules
the install step performs the following additional tasks: 

* Creates a samson operating system user without setting a password 
* Adds an environment script file to /etc/profile.d that adds SAMSON_HOME and
  SAMSON_WORKING to each shell environment 
* Installs an init.d script that will start up the SAMSON platform, in
  particular the samsonSpawner process when the server restarts 

To start the SAMSON platform either reboot the server or execute 

sudo /etc/init.d/samson start 

For information on administering the SAMSON platform see the SAMSON Users Manual
