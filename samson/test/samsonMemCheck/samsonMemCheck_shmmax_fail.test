Found enough shared memory for SAMSON, samson_required_mem(536870912) <= max_memory_size(8589934592)
The system shared memory segment size (kernel.shmmax) is too small for samson. The system allows for a maximum size of 33554432 and we need 268435456
Set kernel.shmmax to 268435456 using the command 'sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=268435456'.
