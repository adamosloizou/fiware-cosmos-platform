Last time it was tested, mongodb was out of the loop, to test only SAMSON performance.
Check the module to see if you are OK with the options.
If not, modify, recompile and distribute. 

- To initialize SAMSON cluster

from samson01.o2:
$ samsonSpawnAll (in the last times, samson4 was dead, so it is not in the script)
$ samsonStarter (con la variable SAMSON_CLUSTER definida a las mÃ¡quinas correspondientes)

- To initilize the SAMSON module:

delilah> init_stream_operation passive_location.demo
This will prepare the add_stream_operations needed in the solution

-To push static tables (cells and users):
they are in  
samson1.o2:/spare/passive_location
From here
delilah> push users.txt 00.in_users
delilah> push cell_site_lookup_20120209.txt 00.in_cells

-To push the blobs of tektronix
From the directory of blobs
$cd /samson/indigo/201112


for d in *; do passiveLocationPush -dir $d -rate 25 -queue 02.in_tek_cdrs; echo $d terminado; sleep 60; done

If connected to mongo, data will be arriving there.
In the last tests, a set of pre-created by-hour collections were used
trying to get better performance. If needed, there is a script to create
those collections, based in Grant's one.

The passive_location module is also connected to the level module,
so the output counts of users should be in a queue like
99.level.04.levels_updates_txt (or similar)
