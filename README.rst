The Big Data Platform is a product that allows you to:

- run map-reduce jobs in both batch and near-real-time modes
- create and release clusters of different sizes
- create and monitor jobs
- set up external storage from Telefonica's cloud solution
- connect to get data in and out via SFTP, streaming, and HTTP
- make sure their cluster is not out of storage space
- allow the user to RDP into the head node for any additional advanced
  functionality, except if this compromises cluster performance
- provide fast, scalable consumption APIs
- support for productized analytical models and base ML techniques
