/** Infinity client API.
  *
  * API methods return Scala futures to provide asynchronous access to the Infinity server side.
  * When operations fail, they include an exception derived from InfinityException but you should
  * be prepared to catch exceptions produced by the ExecutionContext or by unexpected conditions.
  *
  * All API methods can fail with the following exceptions:
  *
  *  * ConnectionException        when it is not possible to contact the infinity server
  *  * UnauthorizedException      when credentials being used are rejected
  *  * ProtocolMismatchException  when client and server don't understand each other
  *  * ForbiddenException         when user access rights are not enough to perform the action
  *
  * Apart from those, every method can fail with specific exceptions.
