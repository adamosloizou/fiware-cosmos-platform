.SH NAME
samson\-system \- call data record processing
.SH DESCRIPTION
The samson SYSTEM library defines basic data types.

.SH DATA TYPES
  Int32 (int)
  Int16 (unsigned short)
  Int8 (char)
  UInt  (unsigned int, variable length)
  UInt64 (size_t)
  UInt32 (unsigned int)
  UInt16 (short)
  UInt8 (unsigned char)
  Double (double)
  Float (float)
  String (string)
  Void (void)
  UInt2 (dupla de UInt)
  TimeUnix (time_t)
  Date (date format used in some cdr solutions)
  Time (time format used in some cdr solutions)
  TimeSlot (time slot with week day information used in mobility solution)
  ComplexTimeSlot (set of TimeSlot)

.SH FUNCTIONS
Only two parsing functions are defined in this module:
  Parser  parse_id_id(out UInt2-Void)
  Parser  parser_uint_void(out UInt-Void)
