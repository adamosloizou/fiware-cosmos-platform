Introduction
-------------


SNA module is in charge of computing cliques and communities from a graph
Please, see documentation of module cdr and graph for more information about the previous
steps necessary to get a graph from cdrs.


Quick tutorial
----------------

To start with cliques-finding problem, we should have a graph data-set.
This is basically a data-set with key-value format (system.UInt graph.Node)
If you want just to play a bit, use graph.fake_graph generator to get a simple graph.

The main script to get cliques from a graph is sna.compute_cliques
sna.compute_cliques takes a single input parameter ( graph data set ) and produce a cliques data-setsas an output. 

Note that cliques data-sets have key-format ( sna.Clique system.Void )

Finally, we can use sna.export_cliques to transform cliques data-set into a txt data-set and download it to local using "download" command in delilah console.

Hope you enjoy this module!!!
