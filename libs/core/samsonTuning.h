*
* SAMSON is a platform for stream-oriented process of data sources.
* It is specially designed to process high-volumen sources with stream-map&reduce operations
*
* Everything is optimized to perform as much as possible all operations in memory.
* At the same time, SAMSON is a map&reduce distributed platform based on MACRO
* (previous version of the map&reduce platform of Telef√≥nica I+D)
* 
* Architecture:
*
* Network Manager (SSNetworkManager) is the component to interacto with other nodes and with the exterior
*
* Memory Manager  (SSNetworkManager) is the component to manage memory of a samson-node.
*                 It offers a threat-safe quick API to obtain memory blocks (KVBlock)
*                 It is responsible for backing up everything on disk as needed and put back in memory
* 
* Task Manager    (TaskManager) is the component responsible to run all process operations
*                 Is is responsible to keep a list of tasks with dependencies that can run independently in all available cores
*	
* KV Manager      (KVManager) is the component to manage the KV-Storages, KV-Sets and in general all data elements
* 
* SAMSON Manager  (SSManager) is the general component to manage a samson node
