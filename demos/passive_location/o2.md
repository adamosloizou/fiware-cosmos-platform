= O2 UK Passive Location Pilot

== Introduction

This file contains information relevant to those involved in the O2 UK
Passive Location pilot. Please do not distribute this without consulting
samson-dev@tid.es as it contains passwords and access to sensitive
information.

== Machines

There are 5 machines for SAMSON and 12 for Mongodb. Those machines are

samson1 172.30.5.132
samson2 172.30.5.133
samson3 172.30.5.134
samson4 172.30.5.135
samson5 172.30.5.136

mongo1..mongo12 10.200.64.41..53

root password - sdWqrw23gY
samson password - samson

Access without any password is setup via samson1@samson1.hi.inet

== Preparing Samson

There are several bash functions in .bashrc that simplify basic running of the
cluster:

samsonKillAll - runs samsonKiller on each machine
samsonResetAll - runs samsonSpawner -reset -vvvvv on each machine
samsonSpawnAll - runs samsonSpawner -vvvvv on each machne
runAll - run the supplied command on each machine
psAll - list the samson processes on each machine

To access another machine just type its name, e.g.

    samson4

To run a single commmand on samson4 from samson1 run:

    samson4 tail /tmp/samsonSpawnerLog

== Demo steps

The following assumes everything is run from samson1. Prepare Samson
using:

   samsonKillAll
   samsonResetAll
   samsonStarter -controller samson1 \
           -ips 'samson2 samson3 samson1 samson4 samson5'

Prepare passive location data

   cd $HOME/trunk/demos/passive_location
   echo -y | ./demo_init samson1   
   echo -y | ./demo_load_cells samson1

=== Test Data Generator

To send test data:

   passiveLocationGenerator 10000 | samsonPush pl.in_xml_cdrs -v -buffer_size 10000

=== Live Data

To send live data:

   arcanumConsumer -host 172.17.200.201 -port 1099 | samsonPush 01.in_xml_cdrs -v -buffer_size 10000
